# Exercise-2

As described in the [git-basics
chapter](https://info201.github.io/git-basics.html), you should begin
by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine.

In the space below, make a three column table of the current courses
you are taking, with separate columns for course number (in **bold**),
course title (in _italics_), and instructor.

| Course Title  | _Course #_    | Instructor   |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Info 201      | 201           | Ott Toomet   |
| Math 307      | 307           | Bobby Wilson |
| Info 101      | 101           | Bob Boiko    |
