# Exercise-3

As described in the [git-basics
chapter](https://info201.github.io/git-basics.html), you should begin
by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if
you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal
command you've learned thus far in the class (or elsewhere ;-).  In particular, you
should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command

An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)

A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

## Mkdir [directory_name]

This terminal command allows the user to create a new directory or folder with the simple command immediately followed by the name they wish to assign. Below is an example in how to use this in the bash shell:

`mkdir class1exercises`

- Mkdir stands for **M**a**k**e **Dir**ectory
- Main use is to make a new directory inside the current folder
  - if the folder does not exist it makes all parents ones that precede it

See `complete` branch for answers.
